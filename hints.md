# Hints for Working on this Assignment:
## HTML
* Make sure that you are using semantic tags whenever possible. Some classes may be better as tags.
* Make sure that all links work functionally. Remember that a `#reference` in the `href` attribute will link you to an `id` on the page.
* Ensure that ALL images have `alt` attributes that describe the image itself.
## CSS
* Consolidate CSS where applicable. If 3 different classes all have the same styling, you can probably do that in 1 class.
* Make sure that classes appear in order of appearance on the stylesheet.
## General
* Don't break styles. If you change a tag in HTML, update all relevant tags in CSS. If you consolidate tags in CSS, update the tags in HTML.
